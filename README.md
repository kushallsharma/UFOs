# UFO Sightings

The project is to publish an article on UFO sightings alongside a dataset of all the UFO sightings over an internet webpage. The dataset has to be tabulated and users must be able to interact with the data. To ease the access of data users should have ability to filter the data on multiple criteria like date of sightings, city, state, country and shape of the UFO. The project is implemented using pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Summary

The article is published on the webpage and hence it is available for entire world to view it. Anyone can open the page, view the article and play with the data of UFO sighting with ease of filtering it at multiple level. 

However, there are few drawbacks of this design and one is that the data is just below the article and makes it cumbersome to scroll and check full data as it is a long list. Another issue is that, entire data has been listed below on one single page. Hence, as a recommendation we can keep the data on another page and providing link to the page at the bottom of article and paginate the data so that only finite number of rows such 20 or 50 rows would be visible at one go. This will increase the aesthetics of the webpage and improve user readability.
